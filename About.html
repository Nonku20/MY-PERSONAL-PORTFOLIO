                <p>I come from a town called Newcastle in KZN, that is where I was born and bred.<br>
                    I mostly enjoy being in doors just watching TV and playing some online games<br>
                    like FPS(First=Person-Shooter) and FIFA.<br>
                    I am a highly driven software developement student and I enjoy coding and developing<br>
                    different applications and working as a back-end developer. My interest in Software<br>
                    development started back in 2019 when I decided to apply for an IT course. Turns out<br>
                    that was the best choice I ever made. During the past 3 years of my study I really<br> 
                    enjoyed programming and learning all the fundamentals of programming, and creating<br>
                    graphical user interfaces
